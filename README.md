# Ambient.ai_Test
Code Solution for Question given in Interview

# Dependencies Needed:

1. Keras
2. Tensorflow
3. Python 3.0

# Steps to Run:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Go to the directory of the repository on command prompt.
3. Type `python run.py`.
4. Give a value **between 0-100** when prompted to do so.
5. Output will be displayed on the screen.

# Important 

1. The network is trained to output squares only for numbers between 1 to 100.
2. The network can learn the quadratic function till a certain range, depending on the training data.
3. The network approximates the results to a certain range, in this case within +/- 200.
4. The network can be made more complex to learn the quadratic function for a larger range of numbers, and to a better approximation.
5. The code of the network can be checked in `Untitled.ipynb`.
